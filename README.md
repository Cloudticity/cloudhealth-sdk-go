# CloudHealth API in Go

A Go wrapper for the [CloudHealth Cloud Management Platform](https://www.cloudhealthtech.com/) API.

## Getting Started

Run the following command to retrieve the SDK:

```bash
go get -u github.com/nextgenhealthcare/cloudhealth-sdk-go
```

You will also need an API Key from CloudHealth. For more information, see [Getting Your API Key](http://apidocs.cloudhealthtech.com/#documentation_getting-your-api-key)

```go
import cloudhealth "github.com/nextgenhealthcare/cloudhealth-sdk-go"

client, _ := cloudhealth.NewClient("api_key", "https://chapi.cloudhealthtech.com/v1/")

account, err := client.GetSingleAwsAccount(1234567890)
if err == cloudhealth.ErrAwsAccountNotFound {
	log.Fatalf("AWS Account not found: %s\n", err)
}
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Unknown error: %s\n", err)
}

log.Printf("AWS Account %s\n", account.Name)
```
